C1074.100	imp substances..   1\. Angami Zapu Phizo had carved out Nagaland from Assam as per d geographical dominance n population b4 1980.   2\. under his political/social agenda, 16 tribes r consider as Nagas which perhaps confine in Nagaland.   3\. during dt time there is no recognition of Nagas among those tribes in Manipur.   4\. Besides Its manifesto is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development and a Baptist Christian religious outlook. In some of their documents the NSCN has called for recognizing only the Baptist religion. They have also on occasion kidnapped Catholic priests. this implies bringing religious confrontation esp vt d Hindu Meiteis.   5\. so if d Meiteis r baptise would thea b unity n integrity vt strong border intigrity or merging s Nagalim.?   6.The origin of Naga Struggle is traced back to the founding of the Naga Club, in Kohima in 1918 by a group of educated Nagas. They submitted a memorandum to the Simon Commission to exclude the Nagas from any constitutional framework of India. With the coming of Angami Zapu Phizo, popularly called as Phizo, the Naga Movement gained momentum in the late 1940s.   7.NSCN is accused of carrying out the 1992‚Äì1993 ethnic cleansing of Kuki tribes in Manipur, said to have leave over 900 people dead. During that NSCN- IM operation, 350 Kuki villages were driven out and about 100,000 Kukis were turned into refugees claiming d devastated villages a Naga Habited region later on, s a part of expanding Naga Territory.   8\. In May 1994, it was believed to be responsible for the massacre of sixteen people in a church in Nagaland. In December 1996, NSCN guerrillas boarded a bus in Guwahati (Nagaland), killed thirty people and injured a further twenty- four, all of whom were Kuki tribesman.   9.Subsequently, Nagaland attained statehood with the enactment of the state of Nagaland Act in 1962 by the Parliament. The interim body was dissolved on 30 November 1963 and the state of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963 and Kohima was declared as the state capital.   10\. so their views geting broader by force grouping of many tribes originating n residing in Manipur since d late 1980..at d gun point.   11\. thea is no official community called Naga in Manipur n d self styl Nagas r d Kaccha Nagas in Nagaland.
