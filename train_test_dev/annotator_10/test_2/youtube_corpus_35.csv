C35.2	hinduism is not against homosexuality but many hindus are...sad how they are influenced more by the culture of the people who invaded and looted it more than their own culture and religion..ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”	CAG	NtAG	CNS	NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	ETH
C35.88	quote me any scientific journal that says its a choice there is no evidence of anybody choosing their sexuality. gays didn't choose to be gay any more than you chose to be straight	NAG			NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C35.83	aids is not exclusive to homosexuals. if it is as big a problem as you claim, then proper response would be to promote safe sex practices and using condoms. and transsexuals have absolutely nothing to do with aids who the hell told you all that?	CAG	NtAG		NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C35.78.1	there are many religious texts and other instances which proves that homosexuality is normal....sanatan dharma is about spirituality hence it dosen't matter if u are straight gay lesbian bisexual transgender theist atheist etc....everyone is accepted in one way or the other .....also for the theists sanatan dharma have all forms of gods may it be male,female,transgender,formless ,homosexual,animal like,rivers,trees etc.....always remember in sanatan dharma one can find god/inner peace/spirituality/salvation only and only by him/her self not by any other means......

C35.84	what is moral is not decided by the majority but by reason, just as finding out objective truths. (most people thought earth was flat then, that didn't make it true) and what does the evidence say? homosexuality is a normal part of the animal kingdom and has been observed in over 1500 species. (wiki: homosexuality in animals) there is no evidence that it is a choice. when did you choose to be heterosexual? (assuming you are) you can certainly choose to hide it or say the truth, but not being gay	NAG			NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C35.89	tbh i don't agree with homosexuality. in fact i find the whole sexual intercourse between 2 men as disturbing. but that does not mean i would victimise or be cruel to a gay person! never! that's not in my nature. but to me, i think sexual behaviours, wether its prostitution, transsexuals and gays are a problem for society and will soon realise why when aids is one of the rapid spreading diseases in the world!

C35.121	thats true i belong to a christian community .. what you commented is correct ..only abrahmic faiths judaism christianity and islam opposes homosexuality along with other unnatural sexual acts like beastiality , incest , and adultery etc; well giving rigths to homosexuals is justice and rational in my opinion its not unnatural	NAG			NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH

C35.37	"homosexuality : is it natural ?[å›°]      not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind of judgment on our brothers & sisters .      the question that should be asked is,   where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?      cause when god created this universe & everything in this universe to obey him & his law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created. the planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .      i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. they all obey the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a certain nature in which he is created.      the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23Â°c ,30 minutes ,the planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural inclination or leaning.      man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans towards the man.      now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?      it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural way of god & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the natural course, his whole life style will be a deviation.      the bible clearly says ,he changed the ""truth"" of god into a lie & when you pervert the truth of god & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in africa walking around with broken wrists .      since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this behavior.      scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a woman ,we have seen that ""thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about him begins to change according to his thoughts.      so scripture says "" behold i the sovereign lord, make all things new"" so we must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the expression of the man.      there is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, god is here to change us all up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were created."

C35.86	there is evidence for heterosexuality. there must be for homosexuality too.. i am not saying that it is wrong. i am saying that it is a choice and hence people who attack heterosexuals for saying it's not natural is not right,because what is natural is defined by what the majority feel is natural and what results in an outcome which is necessary for the existence of the human species.both are necessary/	NAG			NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
