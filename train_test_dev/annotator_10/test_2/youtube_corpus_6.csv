C6.2356	i have not seen kabir singh,and won’t see it [either.my](http://either.my/) opinion is based on arjun reddy.i am not a feminist but really the movie is highly misogynistic with zero respect for women and treat them as an [object.gives](http://object.gives/) a bad message and display this as a heroism.   my observations:-   \- boy goes after and gets the girl, as if she’s his private property and her opinion just doesn’t matter.   \- names his dog after the girl   \- beats the girl   \- runs after his maid to beat her for a piece of glass   \- announces in front of the whole class that apart from this girl,every other girl is yours in present and upcoming batches   \- despite with all drugs and alcohol addiction,he performs his duty as a doctor in a wonderful manner!   there are more which i haven’t mentioned.the movie is full of these things and sadly these acts are presented/celebrated in a heroic manner.any sensible person won’t sympathise with this kind of flawed character who shows zero respect for the women.
