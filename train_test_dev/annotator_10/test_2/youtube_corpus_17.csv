C17.176	in her conversation with abish, she said that the south director /producer was obsessed with navel of a woman, so he chorepgraphs songs with fruits n flowers falling on the part of the body.. the producer was k. ragavendra rao.. she received a lot of flak n anger from south for saying so.. immediately she retracted from. the statement.. that's the difference between her and kangana, kangana would. never play a diplomatic card and would have owned up n stood her ground, but taapsee gave in n apologised even.. speaking up takes lots of guts, hence she saying kangana to use double filter was not only disrespectful but stupidity	CAG	NtAG		GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
