C37.7.1	@mιss crαzy people, how dumb are you! everyone is born heterosexual thus it's the standard. then later on there happens to be these people who just want to be different for the sake of it and choose to deviate and become gay hence the choice. to put it clearly then would be to say, 'everyone is born heterosexual and then they face the choice whether to remain so or not.'

C37.7.2	@iihamed711 homosexuality is a sexuality. so if they think someone chooses their sexuality, then that basically means they chose to be heterosexual too. and if that's the case, you may not actually be straight   coz noone chooses their sexuality	NAG			GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C37.7.4	if y'all dumbasses think homosexuality is a choice, then guess y'all chose to be heterosexual. and if that's the case, then hate to break it to you, but you may not be straight.   you do not choose your sexuality, homophobe.	OAG	CuAG	ATK	GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
