C40.7	"**"" because of this, god gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.""** romans [1:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkrwdvgnrjy&t=1m26s)-27"	NAG			GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.4	fun fact: research shows that homophobic men are repressed homosexuals and that actual heterosexual men aren't the least bit bothered nor worried about another man's sexuality and that homophobic women are insecure because of their lack of physical attributes.	NAG			GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.131	it's just sad that we have come to a point where homosexuals cannot avail their fundamental rights without glorifying or promoting themselves. it is not the fault of homosexuals that their activities end up being glorification. had homosexuality been accepted and considered as normal by everyone, this would never have happened. to be fair, this is the case with most other oppressed communities be it women or dalits. all i want to say is that inorder for the lgbt people to be accepted and integrated into the society, some degree of desensitization and promotion is necessary. otherwise, even this historic judgement would not have been possible.

C40.116.1	let me explain what he said. religion has nothing to do with sexuality. it's a discipline that helps people keep harmony in their lives and accept others. and religion says about love only that's pure without any expectations. as long as love is love and pure is not a sin but when it becomes lust there's suffering whether it's between heterosexual or homosexual couples. and as long as freedom is all about own satisfaction or happiness (whether a sin or not) and doesn't harm others , it's acceptable but beyond that there is rules and law against it.

C40.59.3	becoz he is straight ...so its hard for him to understand to understand homosexuality...but its everyone personal prefrences so we dont need to discuss it thats what he wanted to say...which is similar to me...homosexuality is out of my understanding but i respect others choices...

C40.83	"what does he mean by ""promote"" homosexuality? it's not something that one is out of choice and some kind of social influence. no amount of ""promotion"" can make a heterosexual a homosexual and vice versa. people just are what they are."	NAG		CNS	NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.47.1	because homosexuality has always been a natural and normal aspect of human sexuality. then there are all of the levels of bisexuality.	NAG			NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.87	he is awesome...it doesn't require promotion it is natural like any heterosexual life so why should we segregate that and promote it as if it is something to be told. if we have to change people's minds there is a whole set of issues like caste religion which also includes sexuality which people do not accept and stand by their views. until and unless no one harm others mentally or physically no need for any lectures or opinions	NAG		CNS	NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.169	no homosexuality is not against religion.      religion is against homosexuality!	CAG	NtAG		NGEN	COM	NCAS	NETH
C40.37	"sounds like liberals funded this clown. the only reasons our bodies develop sexual desires and impulses is to create life!! the pleasure is secondary. but if you grow up in a society where sexuality is sensationalized and overly exposed. you going to think it's for pleasure solely and creating life is a after thought.. but homosexuality omits ""creating"" all together"	OAG	NtAG		GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.150	heterosexuality doesnt get promoted therefore homosexuality doesnt need to get promoted too. promoting it discriminates it in a way. we all should just normalize it and be unbothered about it.	OAG	NtAG		GEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
C40.36	but homophobia is there in society and by making this topic known to more people and tell them it's absolutely normal we can reduce homophobia to a certain extent so we should talk about these topics. why? bcz no one till now talked abt this that's why these topics are taboo in our society. and we need to understand the need of not discriminating people based on their sexual preferences. i think sadgurus answer was diplomatic.
