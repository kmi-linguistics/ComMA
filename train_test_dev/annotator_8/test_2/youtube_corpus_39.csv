C39.56	@casna101 no not all are transsexuals its hard to figure out some guys act like girls some girls act like guys some guys don't know to be masculine or flamboyant. its all an act guys act straight and then when they turn gay they go for the lisp and the swish and the totally fake attitude. proves its not genetic but some learned behavior. yes you do whine, about everything and i don't care about ny its all fucked up anyway, they accept anyone and anything even gay muslims.

C39.26	100%...wrong. homosexuality is not a disease or sickness. yes, it spreads but in a positive way. diseases spread by touch. homosexuality spreads by heart, spirit and mind, affecting it's host in a way that allows them to be themselves and experience the pleasures that a man would give to a woman. i'm transgender and bi and i love being myself. nothing that this guy or anyone else says can change me.

C39.45	"@vikingwindmill eduacted sane people do not accept that homosexuality is a disease because they are ""educated and sane"". medical sciences have taken a firm stance on homosexuality saying that it is not a disease. you can choose to be a serial killer but that would be unacceptable because lives will be lost, homosexuality involves two adults who agree with consent to have sex with each other without troubling anyone else. please read some medical journals on homosexuality."
