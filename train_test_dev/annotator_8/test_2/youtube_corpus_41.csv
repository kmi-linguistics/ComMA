C41.433.1	homosexuality is a disorder, created by a warped cognition.      humans evolved with specific emotions and organs with a goal in mind. for instance, males developed penises for reproduction. how does nature encourage one to reproduce? sexual attraction. how does nature encourage one to reproduce again after already done so? sexual pleasure that releases dopamine that happens after release of sperm or female orgasm.      other forms of love exist just to develop social bonds which creates a herd group since humans are social animals. males and females were not meant to have sex with the same sex. friendship? yes. sex in the butt or fingering? no.      homosexuals that still have vaginas and penises are going against their natural evolution and experience feelings that are abnormal in how nature intended. biology isn't perfect (yes, psychology is biology with behaviorism).      it's a disorder through and through. doesnt matter if it hurts the individual or not. a disorder is whenever your emotions are out of balance or do not serve their purpose.

C41.123	all this stigmatisation of lesbianism and homosexuality is all coming from stupid hypocrisy of abrahamic religions. ancient india was very liberal about sexuality. everyone must read this book 2016 book karmasutra the karma of book by staju jacob if they are interested in karma of sex. most topical sexual actions are also covered. mind-blowing analysis of karma. the karmic reasons for different sexual preferences are also explored in chapter 12. the stupid hypocrisy of xtians and other religions are also exposed.

C41.418.5	i knew it !! i knew that you were gonna ask me that as your next question. see. i clearly told you that the examples that i gave dont prove anything. so i did not imply that choosing or not choosing are related to normal or natural behaviour. its just that the statistics speak something. no one really knows what it is, all the way down to the fundamentals of sexuality. and by the way, bestiality may be just normal or natural. or it maybe just disgusting. but who knows ? maybe bestiality is just another form of sexual orientation ! buuuut. why should people be against it then ?? simple. because even though a person may wanna have sex with an animal, there is no way of knowing whether the animal also wants to have sex with the person. i told you in that previous comment that consensual relationships are nobody's business. animals cant give consent, coz neither can we understand them nor can they understand us. you can end up raping the animal. so that closes the chapter on bestiality and it must be forbidden. next question that you may wanna ask is: pedophilia ! so, again, pedophilia may just be another form of sexual orientation. who knows ? buuut again ! a child is not really capable of giving consent, isnt it ? that's why we have laws in most countries about the age of consent. some places its 16 some 18 blah blah blah. but its not 12 years old anywhere, i guess. coz most kids are just too immature at that age, even though different kids start maturing at different ages. no one actually knows what the right age is. maybe we'll never know. but its reasonable to assume that kids are mature by the time they are like 15 or 16 so that is the widely accepted age range of consent in many countries. but it is always dangerous for a pedophile to assume that a kid that he wants to have sex with can give him/her consent, bcoz you dont really know if the child is old enough to think about it. thats why sex with children should also be forbidden, well until they reach the age of maturity, as i have been saying all along. so if an adult wants to have sex with an animal or a child, but never acts upon his/her desires, well then that is fine and he/she should not be criminalized in society. there is a difference between a pedophile and a child molester. but anyway, you get my point, i hope. now i know the next question you are probably gonna ask, but ill wait for your reply to see if thats what it is. lol	NAG			NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH

C41.394	i'm gay too, but i find all this advertisement of sexuality and debauchery as nauseating. we need different kinds of campaigns, talks, something that don't advertise sense pleasures, and sexuality and actually show gay people as normal ppl, and an integral part of the culture and indic religion. you don't achieve that by trying to stand out from the crowd in this fashion, importing sjw liberal feminist nonsense.

C41.99	why are they against modi and rss but not against evil islam? islam teaches muslims to kill homsexuals but i am yet to see one lgbt group even saying a word against evil islam. why this double standard? is it because they know muslims are not tolerant and will kill them for saying such things? isn't that enough for your gayturds and libturds to know, that modi and rss are still tolerant?
