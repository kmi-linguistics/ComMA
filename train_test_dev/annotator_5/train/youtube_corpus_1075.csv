C1075.30	"The Naga movement in Nagaland, we the people of Manipur (Meitei, kuki and other tribes) sincerely support their wish for self determination. But Muivah is a murderer, hiding behind the image of Christianity. We are totally against him. The more you dive deeper into his history, you will realise what an evil man he and his group is.   1\. Why and how was general Kaito, the great Sema Naga leader assassinated in broad daylight? Who was behind it?   The then CM of Nagaland, a sema, was also ambushed, but luckily he survived.   Forget about other communities, How many nagas in Nagaland died in the hands of Muivah? And why? Look it up. Read.   How ""Nagalim for Christ"" came to be? ""Christ"" was added later when he realised the nagas in Nagaland were hard-core Christian/church supporters and he needed to manipulate them to gain their support. Earlier he got backlash for burning churches.   2\. MUIVAH REJECTED THE FATHER OF NAGALIM, Angami Zapu Phizo's leadership. Thats how NSCN was formed.   3\. After NSCN-IM was formed, how many kukis and meiteis and other tribal members were massacred? The Kuki's have a dedicated 'black day' in remembrance of the killings of kukis by the NSCN-IM, an ethnic cleansing.   4\. How many Manipuri lives were lost, innocent lives. Extortion, Ransome. They usually work with some Indian govt. officials like the IAS, IPS who get posted in the hills(like Kasom Khullen) and take money meant for development and if the officer refused, he/she will be attacked. That's how the SDO of Kasom Khullen, Thingnam Kishan and two of his associates were murdered. He was loved by many tribals under and outside of his jurisdiction because he was very sincere and kind but NSCN murdered him. I have personally witnessed this. And those who know, knows. There were many other places like Kasom Khullen.   To say that Muivah is an evil person would be an understatement. If you truly, sincerely stand for humanity, unity, love and kindness, GOD, and still support Muivah, think again or visit a psychiatrist."	CAG	NtAG		NGEN	NCOM	NCAS	NETH
